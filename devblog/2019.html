        Latest Evennia dev blog:  Evennia 2.0.0 released today: <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Field_Hamois_Belgium_Luc_Viatour.jpg" alt="screenshot" />
<br></p>
<p>As part of our new use of <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>, Evennia
2.0.0 was released today. Evennia is a Python <code>MU*</code> creation framework and
server. As the change of the major version indicates, this is a backwards
incompatible change ... well, <em>maybe</em>. It depends on your use-case. Read on.</p>
<p>In this post I&#x27;ll go over some of the new things since the release of Evennia
1.0 some six months ago.</p>
<h2>New version of the ExtendedRoom</h2>
<p>The main thing that <em>may</em> be backwards income is the <code>ExtendedRoom</code> contrib.
This contrib extends the standard room with the ability to look at &#x27;details&#x27; and
to have descriptions that change by season and by time-of-day in the game. I
originally wrote the <code>ExtendedRoom</code> contrib more than a decade ago and it was
in dire need to be recactored and cleaned up to use the modern tools available
in Evennia. Not to mention make use of my additional years of experience since
first creating it.</p>
<p>Here are the <a href="https://github.com/evennia/evennia/discussions/3200">new features</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>All rooms can now have any number of &quot;room states&quot;, like &quot;burning&quot;, &quot;flooded&quot;,
&quot;dark&quot;, &quot;crowded&quot; or what have you. The <code>season</code> and <code>time_of_day</code> are now just
treated as any other room-states except that they auto-change with in-game time.</li>
<li>Rooms can have any number of swappable room-descriptions, just by adding an
Attribute <code>desc_&lt;roomstate&gt;</code> to the room. This will be used when a given
room-state is set on the room. If no room state matches, the traditional
<code>desc</code> Attribute is used.</li>
<li>In the old contrib, you could add special tags, like <code>&lt;morning&gt;...&lt;/morning&gt;</code>
in your descriptions and have those parts of the texts only appear when it&#x27;s
morning in-game. This still works, but only ever supported time-of-day states.
The new way is to make use Evennia&#x27;s FuncParser to embed functions in the text
directly. The <code>ExtendedRoom</code> understands the new <code>state</code> inline function. This
can be used with <em>any</em> room state (including seasons and time-of-day). For
example: <code>$state(morning, The morning sun is shining in.)</code> or
<code>$state(burning, This place is on fire!)</code>.</li>
<li>The room still supports <code>details</code> - the ability to look at things in the room
without needing to create a new database object first. This hasn&#x27;t changed.</li>
<li>The <code>ExtendedRoom</code> now also has simple support for echoing random messages now
and then to the room.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the code was completely re-written and cleaned up, making use of the
latest Evennia tooling. It also has much better unit-test coverage. All the unit
tests of the old implementation passes for the new one, but the changes are
so big that it&#x27;s nevertheless possible people making heavy use of
this contrib may see side effects from upgrading.</p>
<p>Now, a contrib is not part of the core, so it (potentially) being
backwards-incompatible should normally not warrant a major version bump. But I
feel the <code>ExtendedRoom</code> contrib is used by so many in the Evennia community that
it&#x27;s prudent to up the major version to let people know that they should
keep an eye out when upgrading.</p>
<h2>More on the Beginner Tutorial</h2>
<p>Most of my time has been spent continuing to work on the new <a href="https://www.evennia.com/docs/latest/Howtos/Beginner-Tutorial/Beginner-Tutorial-Overview.html">Beginner Tutorial</a>. Notably on <a href="https://www.evennia.com/docs/latest/Howtos/Beginner-Tutorial/Part3/Beginner-Tutorial-Part3-Overview.html">part three</a>, where
we are making a whole little Evennia MUD game from scratch. While still not
done, I have now added detailed lessons on</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating RPG dice rollers and rule systems (in our example we are using the
<em>Knave</em> TTRPG ruleset).</li>
<li>Organizing Player Character data, and character generation.</li>
<li>In-game objects and items.</li>
<li>Handling equipment and weapons.</li>
<li>In-game rooms.</li>
<li>Non-player characters.</li>
<li>Two types of Combat systems (Twitch-based and Turn based).</li>
</ul>
<p>TODOs are Monster/NPC AI, Dynamical generation of rooms, Questin, Shops and some
more bits and bobs. And of course a separate session on building the game world
and tying all these systems together into a little example game.</p>
<h2>A truckload of new features!</h2>
<p>As usual, the Evennia community ame through with a bunch of new useful stuff since
the release of Evennia 1.0.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Containers</code> - A new contrib with a typeclass and commands to make and manage
all sorts of containers, from chests to crates and jars, along with commands
to put things in them and take things out of them. A great place to start
tweaking for your own game implementation (InspectorCaracal).</li>
<li>The ANSI color fallbacks (for use when your client does not support XTerm256)
were improved to make more sense (InspectorCaracal).</li>
<li>New <code>logger.delete_log</code> method for deleting log files from inside the server (aMiss-aWry).</li>
<li>For those intending to override the <code>SessionHandler</code>, it was cleaned up and
refactored to make it less prone to cause circular import issues (Volund).</li>
<li>New <code>create_channel(attr=...)</code> keyword, for setting channel Attributes
directly on creation, especially from channels defined in <code>settings.DEFAULT_CHANNELS</code> (me)</li>
<li>Attributes will now properly save Python <code>deques</code> with <code>maxlen=...</code> set (me).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.evennia.com/docs/latest/Components/Tags.html#tagcategoryproperty"><code>TagCategoryProperty</code></a> - A new way to define tags with a particular category on a class at creation-time, without having to do so in the <code>at_object_creation</code> method (me).</li>
<li>A lot of bug fixes; <a href="https://www.evennia.com/docs/latest/Coding/Changelog.html">see the CHANGELOG</a> for all the details!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Continuing</h2>
<p>Over summer, my development usually slows down a bit, but I plan to keep pushing
on getting that Beginner tutorial done. We are also seeing more people joing
the <a href="https://discord.gg/AJJpcRUhtF">evennia discord</a>, which means more eyes on
the code and more bugs and edge cases being detected (and ironed out). So a lot
of maintenance work to be done in the short term.</p>
<p>In the longer term, there are a lot of exciting plans for Evennia in the pipe,
but we&#x27;ll get there when we get there. :)</p>
<p>Have a nice summer!</p>

        Evennia is a modern Python library and server for creating text-based
        multi-player games and virtual worlds (also known as MUD, MUSH, MU,
        MUX, MUCK, etc). While Evennia handles all the necessary things every
        online game needs, like database and networking, you create the game of
        your dreams by writing normal Python modules."> <!--[if lt IE 9]>

<p>Since <a href="http://evennia.blogspot.com/2019/07/evennia-09-released.html">version 0.9</a> of <a href="http://www.evennia.com/">Evennia</a>, the MU*-creation framework, was released, work has mainly been focused on bug fixing. But there few new features also already sneaked into master branch, despite technically being changes slated for Evennia 1.0.</p>
<h2>On Frontends</h2>
<p>Contributor friarzen has chipped away at improving Evennia&#x27;s HTML5 web client. It already had the ability to structure and spawn any number of nested text panes. In the future we want to extend the user&#x27;s ability to save an restore its layouts and allow developers to offer pre-prepared layouts for their games. Already now though, it has gotten plugins for handling both graphics, sounds and video:</p>

<p>A related fun development is Castlelore Studios&#x27; development of an <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/slug/evennia-plugin">Unreal Engine Evennia plugin</a> (this is unaffiliated with core Evennia development and I&#x27;ve not tried it, but it looks pretty nifty!):</p>

<h2>On Black</h2>
<p>Evennia&#x27;s source code is extensively documented and was <em>sort of</em> adhering to the Python formatting standard PEP8. But many places were sort of hit-and-miss and others were formatted with slight variations due to who wrote the code.</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span>
</pre></div>

<p>After pre-work and recommendation by Greg Taylor, Evennia has adopted the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/black/">black autoformatter</a> for its source code. I&#x27;m not really convinced that black produces the best output of all possible outputs every time, but as Greg puts it, it&#x27;s at least consistent in style. We use a line width of 100.</p>
<p>I have set it up so that whenever a new commit is added to the repo, the black formatter will run on it. It may still produce line widths &gt;100 at times (especially for long strings), but otherwise this reduces the number of different PEP8 infractions in the code a lot.</p>
<h2>On Python3</h2>
<p>Overall the move to Python3 appears to have been pretty uneventful for most users. I&#x27;ve not heard almost any complaints or requests for help with converting an existing game.<br />
The purely Python2-to-Python3 related bugs have been very limited after launch; almost all have been with unicode/bytes when sending data over the wire.</p>
<p>People have wholeheartedly adopted the new f-strings though, and some spontaneous PRs have already been made towards converting some of Evennia existing code into using them.</p>
<p>Post-launch we moved to Django 2.2.2, but the Django 2+ upgrades have been pretty uneventful so far.Some people had issues installing Twisted on Windows since there was no py3.7 binary wheel (causing them to have to compile it from scratch). The rise of the Linux Subsystem on Windows have alleviated most of this though and I&#x27;ve not seen any Windows install issues in a while.</p>
<h2>On Future</h2>
<p>For now we&#x27;ll stay in bug-fixing mode, with the ocational new feature popping up here and there. In the future we&#x27;ll move to the <em>develop</em> branch again. I have a slew of things in mind for 1.0.</p>
<p>Apart from bug fixing and cleaning up the API in several places, I plan to make use of the feedback received over the years to make Evennia a little more accessible for a new user. This means I&#x27;ll also try reworking and consolidating the tutorials so one can follow them with a more coherent &quot;red thread&quot;, as well as improving the documentation in various other ways to help newcomers with the common questions we hear a lot.</p>
<p>The current project plan (subject to change) is <a href="https://github.com/evennia/evennia/projects/9">found here</a>. Lots of things to do!</p>

<p>Last week we released <a href="http://www.evennia.com/">Evennia</a> 0.9, the next version of the open source Python MU* creation system.</p>
<p>This release is the result of about 10 months of development, featuring 771 commits, 70 closed pull requests from the community and something like 80 issues and feature/requests closed. Thanks everyone!</p>
<p>The main feature of Evennia 0.9 is that we have finally made the move to <strong>Python3</strong>. And we burn the bridges behind us; as announced in previous posts we completely drop Python2 support and move exclusively to only support the latest Python3.7.</p>
<p>Overall the move to Python3 was not too bloody (and much work towards a never published py2+3 version was already done by Evennia contributors in a separate branch earlier). The main issues I ran into were mainly in the changes in how Python3 separates strings from bytes. This became crticial since Evennia implements several connection protocols; there were a lot of edge cases and weird errors appearing where data went to and from the wire.</p>
<p>A regular user has it a lot easier though. So far people have not had too much trouble converting their games from 2.7 to 3.7. The biggest Linux distros don&#x27;t all have Py3.7 out of the box though, so that may be a concern for some, we&#x27;ll see.</p>
<p>... but Py3 is nowhere all there is to find in this release though! There are a plethora of <strong>more features</strong> in the latest Evennia, all to make it easier to make the text-based multiplayer game of your dreams.</p>
<p>You can see a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21category-topic/evennia/evennia-news/cOs4HWh0MFQ">summary of new features in the ML announcement</a> and even more details <a href="https://github.com/evennia/evennia/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">in the actual CHANGELOG file</a>.</p>
<p><strong>So what&#x27;s up next?</strong></p>
<p>Now follows a period of bug-fixing and stabilizing. Maybe resolve some of those long-standing &quot;tech-dept&quot; issues and overall make Evennia more stable.</p>
<p>Eventually work will then commence (in the <strong>develop</strong> branch) on version 1.0 of Evennia. For this next release I think I&#x27;ll step back from new features a bit and focus on refactoring and cleanup of the API as well as other things around the library&#x27;s distribution, documentation and presentation.</p>
<p>But for now, onward to summer vacations.</p>

You can read the <a href="https://evennia.blogspot.com/2019/05/creating-evscaperoom-part-1.html">first part of the dev blog here</a>.</p>
<p>This was a game-jam entry I created in a month for the Mud Coder&#x27;s guild&#x27;s <a href="https://itch.io/jam/enterthemud2/rate/422945">Game Jam</a>. The theme was <em>One Room.</em> You can play the game for free in your browser or with a traditional MUD client. There are no spoilers in these blog posts.</p>
<p><em>Update: These days you can play the Evscaperoom by logging into the Evennia demo game at <a href="https://demo.evennia.com">https://demo.evennia.com</a>. It&#x27;s just one of the exits you can get through when you enter.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://evennia.blogspot.com/2019/05/creating-evscaperoom-part-1.html">The first part</a> dealt with the overall game-design aspects. This second, final part will go into details of the code and the systems I built to quickly create all the content. The code referenced here is released under the BSD license and is available <a href="https://github.com/Griatch/evscaperoom">on github</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of this post, players have played <em>Evscaperoom</em> for a little more than a week. At the end I&#x27;ll share some observations and things I learned along the way.</p>
<h2>Ease of building</h2>
<p>Over the one-month game jam, I spent about four days making the game&#x27;s &#x27;engine&#x27; and toolset with Evennia. The rest of the time was spent using those tools to actually create game content (the story, puzzles etc).</p>
<p>An important thing was that I didn&#x27;t want to do any traditional in-game &#x27;building&#x27;. That is - no logging into the game and running various commands to build objects and rooms. This is partly because I wanted rooms to be buildable on-demand, but also because I didn&#x27;t want my game to only exist in the database but in actual version-controllable python modules.</p>
<p>So all of the Evscaperoom is created in code (notably in the game <em>states</em> discussed below). This made it so that I could add unit tests to quickly find bugs and edge cases. It also made it easy to just clone the full game to an online server, init a database and run Evennia on it in a docker when time came to make it public.</p>
<h2>Overall game structure</h2>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qB8ch7ELOKA/XOmHomllRzI/AAAAAAAAKiU/Y9dnXGPgsF4ke8odCDqCrssVJcWScCPGQCLcBGAs/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2019-05-25%2B20-20-17.png"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qB8ch7ELOKA/XOmHomllRzI/AAAAAAAAKiU/Y9dnXGPgsF4ke8odCDqCrssVJcWScCPGQCLcBGAs/s320/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2019-05-25%2B20-20-17.png" alt="The main Evscaperoom menu, showing the option to create a new room or join one of two existing rooms." title="Menu" /></a></p>
<h3>Main menu</h3>
<p>The game loop is simple: When you log in to the game, you get into a menu where you can create a new room to solve or join an existing one. Quitting a room brings you back to that menu. Quitting again leaves the game entirely. In between, you remain inside a single game location (&#x27;room&#x27;).</p>
<p>To make it easier for people to agree to meet up in a room, i made a little &#x27;fantasy name generator&#x27; to make unique random names of the rooms. It felt more thematic than showing room id&#x27;s. The generator combines phonemes together with some very simple logic. Not all comes out easy-to-pronounce, but the result is at least identifiable, like the Sheru and Uyoha above.</p>
<p>I decided that I should not keep empty rooms around, so whenever a room has no more players in it, it&#x27;s deleted from the database along with all its content. This means players can&#x27;t really log off and come back to the same room unless a friend stays behind. I felt it was worth keeping things clean and avoid a growing backlog of empty, unsolved rooms. It is, unfortunately, quite common for players to log in, create a room and then immediately log off.</p>
<p>I distribute <em>Evscaperoom</em> as an Evennia &#x27;game dir&#x27;. Once you&#x27;ve installed Evennia you can just clone the evscaperoom repo and start a new multiplayer server with it. While the game dir has some Evennia templates in it by default, Almost all the custom logic for this game is in <a href="https://github.com/Griatch/evscaperoom/tree/master/evscaperoom">the evscaperoom/ folder.</a> The only other modification I did was to make sure Evennia rerouted new players into the Evscaperoom menu when they connect.</p>
<h3>Room class</h3>
<p>Since all of the gameplay happens in a single room, it made sense to center all of the data-storage around a new, custom Evennia <strong>Room</strong> class. This &quot;EvscapeRoom&quot; class holds all resources for this room. Evennia makes sure to persist it all to the database for you.</p>
<p>The Evennia API provides a lot of powerful but game-general functions. Since our use-case for this game is very strictly defined, I made a slew of helper functions to cut down on boiler plate and pre-set options I wanted to always use.</p>
<p>For example, I added helper methods both for creating and finding objects in the room. On creation, all objects are tagged with the room&#x27;s unique hash, meaning that one can be sure to never have any cross-over between rooms (like accidentally finding the object in another room (that of course has the exact same name). Since I also decided to never have more than one object with a given name per room, I could make these methods very simple.</p>
<p>The room class also has helpers for finding all players in the room and for sending messages to them. It also catches players leaving so that eventual on-character variables can be cleaned.</p>
<p>Importantly, the very action of deleting the room will automatically clean all resources tied to it, keeping things tidy.</p>
<h3>Commands and Objects</h3>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JVAZ65CrRZ0/XOAWibmcrhI/AAAAAAAAKeg/CxL-ddQ5yKk6NnZIrgD7o8FcAatoNazIgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2019-05-17%2B11-38-49.png"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JVAZ65CrRZ0/XOAWibmcrhI/AAAAAAAAKeg/CxL-ddQ5yKk6NnZIrgD7o8FcAatoNazIgCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2019-05-17%2B11-38-49.png" alt="This shows a list of all commands useful in the room." title="The Help screen" /></a></p>
<p>The help screen, show all top-level commands</p>
<p>As discussed in part one of this blog, the Evscaperoom, uses a &#x27;focus&#x27; mode: The player must examine/focus on an object first in order to operate or use it.</p>
<p>The basic command syntax is:</p>
<p><strong>&gt; command [target]</strong></p>
<p>The parsing I made actually allows for a more complex syntax, but in the end this was all that was really needed, since the currently &#x27;focused&#x27; object does not need to be specified. This is the process of using one object with another:</p>
<p><strong>&gt; examine key</strong></p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span>~~ key (examining) ~~   
This is a brass key.  
  
(To unlock something with it, use insert into &lt;target&gt;)  
</pre></div>

<p><strong>&gt; insert into door</strong></p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span> You unlock the **door** with the **key**!  
</pre></div>

<p>(the <em>into</em> is optional). Here, we focus on the key. We get the key&#x27;s description and a hint that you can <em>insert</em> it into things. We then insert it into the door, which is another object in the room. The <em>insert</em> command knows that we are focusing on the key already and that it should look into the room for an object door to use this with.</p>
<p>Technically, these on-object &#x27;actions&#x27; (like <em>insert</em> above), are dynamically generated. Here is an example of the key object:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">class</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">Key</span>(EvscaperoomObject):  
   <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">at_focus_insert</span>(<span style="color: #008000">self</span>, caller, <span style="color: #666666">**</span>kwargs):  
       target <span style="color: #666666">=</span> kwargs[<span style="color: #BA2121">&#39;args&#39;</span>]  
       obj <span style="color: #666666">=</span> caller<span style="color: #666666">.</span>search(obj)  
       <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">if</span> <span style="color: #AA22FF; font-weight: bold">not</span> obj:   
           <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span>   
       <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">if</span> obj<span style="color: #666666">.</span>check_flag(<span style="color: #BA2121">&quot;can_use_key&quot;</span>):  
           obj<span style="color: #666666">.</span>handle_insert(<span style="color: #008000">self</span>)  
</pre></div>

<p>Not shown here is that I made a wrapper for the &quot;no-match&quot; command of Evennia. This command fires when no other commands match. I made this instead analyze the currently &#x27;focused&#x27; object to see if it had a method at_focus_&lt;command_name&gt; on it. If so, I inject the supplied arguments into that method as a keyword argument <em>args</em>.</p>
<p>So when you focus on the key and give the <em>insert</em> command, the at_focus_insert method on the key will be called with a target to insert the key into_._ We search for the target (the door in the example), check if it even accepts keys and then pass the key to that object to handle. It would then be up to the door to figure out if this particular key unlocks it.</p>
<p>I created a library of base objects that I can just use as mixins for the object I want to create. Here&#x27;s an example:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">from</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">evscaperoom</span> <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">import</span> objects  
  
<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">class</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">Box</span>(objects<span style="color: #666666">.</span>Openable,   
    objects<span style="color: #666666">.</span>CodeInput,   
    objects<span style="color: #666666">.</span>Movable):  
    <span style="color: #3D7B7B; font-style: italic"># ...  </span>
</pre></div>

<p>This class will offer actions to open, insert a code and move the object around. It will need some more configuration and addition of messages to show etc. But overall, this method-to-command solution ended up being very stable and extremely easy to use to make complex, interactive objects.</p>
<h3>Room states</h3>
<p>I think of the escape room as going through a series of <em>states</em>. A change of state could for example be that the user solved a puzzle to open a secret wall. That wall is now open, making new items and puzzles available. This means room description should change along with new objects being created or old ones deleted.</p>
<p>I chose to represent states as Python modules in a folder. To be a state, each module needs to have a global-level class <strong>State</strong> inheriting from my new <strong>BaseState</strong> class. This class has methods for initializing and cleaning up the state, as well as was for figuring out which state to go to next. As the system initializes the new state, it gets the current room as argument, so it can modify it.</p>
<p>This is a (simplified) example of a state module:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #3D7B7B; font-style: italic"># module `state_001_start.py`  </span>

</pre></div>

<p>In this simple state, a mug is created, and when you drink from it, the next state is triggered. The base object has a helper function to trigger the next state since I found that interactive with an object is almost always the reason for switching states.</p>
<p>The state-class has a lot of useful properties to set, such as which the next state should be (this can be overridden in case of branching paths). You can also store<br />
a sequence of hints specific for that state.</p>
<h3>Informing the room</h3>
<p>I wrote the content in second-person perspective (<em>&quot;You open the door&quot;</em>). This is however a multiplayer game and I didn&#x27;t intially appreciate how many texts must also exist in a third-party form for the rest of the room to see (<em>&quot;Griatch opens the door&quot;</em>).</p>
<p>As the amount of text grew (the Evscaperoom has close to 10 000 lines of code, a lot of which is content strings), it became clear that it would not be feasible to manually supply third-persion version strings as well.</p>
<p>The solution was to add parsing and translation of pronouns and verbs (a concept I first saw on the game <em>Armageddon</em>).</p>
<p>I write the string like this:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span>    OPEN_TEXT = &quot;~You ~open the *door.&quot;  
</pre></div>

<p>The ~ marks text that should be parsed for second/third-person use (I&#x27;ll discuss the *door marking in the next section). This I then send to a helper method that either sends it only to you (which means it comes back pretty much the same, but without the special markers) or to you <em>and</em> to the room, in which it will look different depending on who receives it:</p>
<p>I see</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>You<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">open</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>the<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">[</span>door<span style="color: #666666">]</span>.
<span style="color: #bbbbbb">  </span>
</pre></div>

<p>Others see</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>Griatch<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>opens<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>the<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">[</span>door<span style="color: #666666">]</span>.<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>
</pre></div>

<p>English is luckily pretty easy to use for this kind of automatic translation - in general you can just add an &quot;s&quot; to the end of the verb. I made a simple mapping for the few irregular verbs I ended up using.</p>
<p>Overall, this made it quick to present multiple viewpoints with minimal extra text to write.</p>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HdLAfVl8P5A/XOAWjd_zoDI/AAAAAAAAKek/KnWDYcsFZP0w1Fb9DEFTd64BkWmnAgIFACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2019-05-17%2B11-49-20.png"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HdLAfVl8P5A/XOAWjd_zoDI/AAAAAAAAKek/KnWDYcsFZP0w1Fb9DEFTd64BkWmnAgIFACPcBGAYYCw/s320/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2019-05-17%2B11-49-20.png" alt="Shows the various accessibility options for showing items." title="option menu" /></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The option menu</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The *door -style marking allowed me to generalize how target-able objects in the room were displayed. This meant that users can customize how objects are shown to them. The default is to mark them both with colors and square brackets (this makes it clear also for people with screen readers). But one can also use only colors or turn off the marking completely (hard mode).</p>
<h2>Bringing it online</h2>
<p>Evennia is both a mud framework and mudserver as well as a webserver based on <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/">Twisted</a>. It runs the game&#x27;s website (with the help of <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>) and also provides its own HTML5 webclient. I tweaked the default website text and played a little with CSS but otherwise didn&#x27;t spend too much time on this bit.</p>
<p>I got a $5/month DigitalOcean droplet with Ubuntu. I made a new, unprivileged &quot;evennia&quot; user on it and cloned the evscaperoom repo to it. I then started a tmux session and ran the Evennia docker image in there. Getting the game online took maybe thirty minutes, most of which was me figuring out where to open the droplet and DigitalOcean firewalls.</p>
<p>I then pointed <a href="http://experimental.evennia.com/">http://experimental.evennia.com</a> at the droplet&#x27;s IP and that was it!</p>
<p>Updating the online server is now only a matter of pushing changes to my github repo, pulling it to the server and reloading Evennia; Before release, I used a private github repo for this, afterwards I simply made it public. Pretty straightforward.</p>
<h1>Some lessons learned</h1>
<p>I have gotten pretty positive reviews on Evscaperoom so far. In the first two days people stumbled on some edge-case bugs, but after that it has been very stable. Mostly I&#x27;ve had to make small typos and grammar corrections as I (or players) spot them.</p>
<p>There were nevertheless some things I learned, some of which led to more real improvements post-launch.</p>
<h2>No amount of help is too much help</h2>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Qd1rZr-X6So/XOpAV1O5cAI/AAAAAAAAKi0/sTtOwnqnj4Iqf5iEMHOUMhIvTJpEGSEiQCLcBGAs/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2019-05-26%2B09-26-49.png"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Qd1rZr-X6So/XOpAV1O5cAI/AAAAAAAAKi0/sTtOwnqnj4Iqf5iEMHOUMhIvTJpEGSEiQCLcBGAs/s320/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2019-05-26%2B09-26-49.png" alt="Shows focus on the &#x27;bed&#x27;, with an example of the header telling how to leave the &#x27;focus&#x27; mode." title="Header example" /></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The header shows how to get out of focus mode</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Firstly, the focus-system (examine, then do stuff) is a little un-orthodox and needs to be explained. I saw people logging in, examining exactly <em>one</em> thing and then logging out. Eventually I found out (because a user told me), that this was likely because they could not figure out how to <em>leave</em> the focus mode. They&#x27;d just flounder about, think the game was buggy and log off.</p>
<p>The answer (just run <em>examine</em> again) is found with the <em>help</em> command, but clearly this was not intuitive. The solution was to add an explicit help text to the top every time you examine something. After this, the confusion seems to have gone away.</p>
<h2>Make it easy to connect for all tastes</h2>
<p>Another example - a commenting user had pretty strong opinions about the fact that you used to have to supply a username and password to play the game. They suggested this was a &#x27;huge hurdle&#x27;. Not sure if that&#x27;s true. But unless you want to use a particular name, there is also no actual gameplay <em>reason</em> to formally authenticate for Evscaperoom.</p>
<p>This was easy to fix. Evennia has guest-player support out of the box so I just activated that and supplied some more fantasy-sounding names than the default &quot;Guest 1&quot;, &quot;Guest 2&quot; etc. Since then, maybe 40% of players connecting have chosen to do so as an anonymous guest. I don&#x27;t know if those would have left completely if the option was not available, but it&#x27;s at least a convenient shortcut for getting into the game.</p>
<h2>Everything takes longer than expected</h2>
<p>I already knew this one, but still I fell into the trap of thinking that things were going well and that there would be plenty of time to finish before deadline.</p>
<p>Creating text content is a lot faster than creating graphical assets, but it&#x27;s still a lot of work. Just the ending &#x27;cinematics&#x27; took me almost two days to finish and clean up at the end.</p>
<p>For once I did pick a reasonable scale for this project though. So while the last few days of the Jam was more intense than I would have liked, I never truly felt like I would not be able to finish in time.</p>
<h2>Building a MU* game in pure code is awesome</h2>
<p>Evennia tries to not instil and specific game type, hence its tools are very general. Wrapping these general tools as a highly opinionated and game-specific toolbox enforced to me just how <em>easy</em> it is to do things when you don&#x27;t need to cover the general case.</p>
<p>Using the tools and creating content purely in-code was great and ended up leading to a <em>very</em> fast content creation. Python works perfectly as a scripting language and I don&#x27;t think there is a reason for using in-game building at all for your game, especially not when you are working on your own like this.</p>
<p>I made a few admin-only commands to jump between states and to set flags, but otherwise most bugs were caught by a generic unit test that just looped over all founds states and tried to initialize them, one after another.</p>
<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>For all my work on the Evennia library/server, I&#x27;ve not actually <em>used</em> it for games of my own very much. This was a great opportunity for doing so. It also gave me the opportunity to test the Python3-development branch of Evennia in a production setting.</p>
<p>I found a few edge-case library bugs which I fixed, but overall things worked very smoothly, also for this kind of game which is certainly far away from the normal MU*-mold that most use Evennia for. I am a bit biased, but overall I felt Evennia to be very mature for the use of making a game from scratch.</p>
<p>In the future I will most likely break out the &#x27;engine&#x27; and tools of the Evscaperoom into an Evennia contrib so that others can make similar games with it easily.</p>
<p>Looking forward to future game jams now!</p>

<p>Over the last month (April-May 2019) I have taken part in the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/enterthemud2">Mud Coder&#x27;s Guild Game Jam</a> &quot;Enter the (Multi-User) Dungeon&quot;. This year the theme for the jam was <em>One Room.</em></p>
<p>The result was <a href="http://experimental.evennia.com/">Evscaperoom</a>, an text-based multi-player &quot;escape-room&quot; written in Python using the <a href="http://www.evennia.com/">Evennia</a> MU* creation system. You can play it from that link in your browser or MU*-client of choice. If you are so inclined, you can also <a href="https://itch.io/jam/enterthemud2/rate/422945">vote for it here</a> in the jam (well, no more).</p>
<p>This little series of (likely two) dev-blog entries will try to recount the planning and technical aspects of the Evscaperoom. This is also for myself - I&#x27;d better write stuff down now while it&#x27;s still fresh in my mind!</p>
<p>Update: The Evscaperoom can these days be played by connecting to the Evennia game demo at <a href="https://demo.evennia.com">https://demo.evennia.com</a>.</p>
<h2>Inception</h2>
<p>When I first heard about the upcoming game-jam&#x27;s theme of <em>One Room</em>, an &#x27;escape room&#x27; was the first thing that came to mind, not the least because I just recently got to solve my my own first real-world escape-room as a gift on my birthday.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with escape-rooms, the premise is simple - you are locked into a room and have to figure out a way to get out of it by solving practical puzzles and finding hidden clues in the room.</p>
<p>While you could create such a thing in your own bedroom (and there are also some one-use board game variants), most escape-rooms are managed by companies selling this as an experience for small groups. You usually have one hour to escape and if you get stuck you can press a button (or similar) to get a hint.</p>
<p>I thought making a computer escape-room. Not only can you do things in the computer that you cannot do in the real world, restricting the game to a single room limits so that it&#x27;s conceivable to actually finish the damned thing in a month.</p>
<p>A concern I had was that everyone else in the jam surely must have went for the same obvious idea. In the end that was not an issue at all though.</p>
<h2>Basic premises</h2>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span>
</pre></div>

<p>I was pretty confident that I would <em>technically</em> be able to create the game in time (not only is Python and Evennia perfect for this kind of fast experimentation and prototyping, I know the engine very well). But that&#x27;s not enough; I had to first decide on how the thing should actually <em>play.</em> Here are the questions I had to consider:</p>
<h3>Room State</h3>
<p>An escape room can be seen as going through multiple <em>states</em> as puzzles are solved. For example, you may open a cabinet and that may open up new puzzles to solve. This is fine in a single-player game, but how to handle it in a multi-player environment?</p>
<p>My first thought was that each object may have multiple states and that players could co-exist in the same room, seeing <em>different</em> states at the same time. I really started planning for this. It would certainly be possible to implement.</p>
<p>But in the end I considered how a real-world escape-room works - people in the same room solves it together. For there to be any <em>meaning</em> with multi-player, they must <em>share</em> the room state.</p>
<p>So what I went with was a solution where players can create their own room or join an existing one. Each such room is generated on the fly (and filled with objects etc) and will change as players solve it. Once complete and/or everyone leaves, the room is deleted along with all objects in it. Clean and tidy.</p>
<p>So how to describe these states? I pictured that these would be described as normal Python modules with a start- and end function that initialized each state and cleaned it up when a new state was started. In the beginning I pictured these states as being pretty small (like one state to change one thing in the room). In the end though, the entire Evscaperoom fits in 12 state modules. I&#x27;ll describe them in more detail in the second part of this post.</p>
<h3>Accessibility and &quot;pixel-hunting&quot; in text</h3>
<p>When I first started writing descriptions I didn&#x27;t always note which objects where interactive. It&#x27;s a very simple and tempting puzzle to add - mention an object as part of a larger description and let the player figure out that it&#x27;s something they can interact with. This practice is sort-of equivalent to <em>pixel-hunting</em> in graphical games - sweeping with the mouse across the screen until you find that little spot on the screen that you can do something with.</p>
<p>Problem is, pixel-hunting&#x27;s not really <em>fun</em>. You easily get stuck and when you eventually find out what was blocking you, you don&#x27;t really feel clever but only frustrated. So I decided that I should <em>clearly mark every object that people could interact with</em> and focus puzzles on better things.</p>
<p>In fact, in the end I made it an option:</p>
<p><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HdLAfVl8P5A/XOAWjd_zoDI/AAAAAAAAKek/GBrnsZDvck0rkeBW2WVLZHXNG6ePqKEjgCEwYBhgL/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2019-05-17%2B11-49-20.png"><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HdLAfVl8P5A/XOAWjd_zoDI/AAAAAAAAKek/GBrnsZDvck0rkeBW2WVLZHXNG6ePqKEjgCEwYBhgL/s400/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2019-05-17%2B11-49-20.png" alt="Option menu (&#x27;quit&#x27; to return)   1: ( ) No item markings (hard mode)  2: ( ) Items marked as item (with color)  3: (*) Items are marked as [item] (screenreader friendly)  4: ( ) Screenreader mode" title="In-game option menu" /></a></p>
<p>As part of this I had to remind myself <em>never to use colors only</em> when marking important information: Visually impaired people with screen readers will simply miss that. Not to mention that some just disable colors in their clients.</p>
<p>So while I personally think option 2 above is the most visually pleasing, Evscaperoom defaults to the third option. It should should start everyone off on equal footing. Evennia has a screen-reader mode out of the box, but I moved it into the menu here for easy access.</p>
<h3>Inventory and collaboration</h3>
<p>In a puzzle-game, you often find objects and combine them with other things. Again, this is simple to do in a single-player game: Players just pick things up and use them later.</p>
<p>But in a multi-player game this offers a huge risk: players that pick up something important and then log off. The remaining players in that room would then be stuck in an unsolvable room - and it would be very hard for them to know this.</p>
<p>In principle you could try to &#x27;clean&#x27; player inventories when they leave, but not only does it add complexity, there is another issue with players picking things up: It means that <em>the person first to find/pick up the item is the only one that can use it and look at it</em>. Others won&#x27;t have access until the first player gives it up. Trusting that to anonymous players online is not a good idea.</p>
<p>So in the end I arrived at the following conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>As soon as an item/resource is discovered, <em>everyone</em> in the room must be able to access it immediately.</li>
<li>There can be <em>no inventory</em>. Nothing can ever be picked up and tied to a specific player.</li>
<li>As soon as a discovery is made, this <em>must be echoed to the entire room</em> (it must not be up to the finder to announce what they found to everyone else).</li>
</ul>
<p>As a side-effect of this I also set a limit to the kind of puzzles I would allow:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>No puzzles must require more than one player to solve</em>. While one could indeed create some very cool puzzles where people collaborate, it&#x27;s simply not feasible to do so with random strangers on the internet. At any moment the other guy may log off and leave you stuck. And that&#x27;s if you even find someone logged in at the same time in the first place! The room should always be possible to solve solo, from beginning to end.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Focusing on objects</h3>
<p>So without inventory system, how <em>do</em> you interact with objects? A trademark of any puzzle is using one object with another and also to explore things closer to find clues. I turned to graphical adventure games for inspiration:<br />
<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hTP1HlMck3c/XOA9-qVnrHI/AAAAAAAAKew/GOVcWIfwyZIr25CZj3VadztdjeVwmzl7gCLcBGAs/s1600/1569-4-secret-of-monkey-island-the.jpg"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hTP1HlMck3c/XOA9-qVnrHI/AAAAAAAAKew/GOVcWIfwyZIr25CZj3VadztdjeVwmzl7gCLcBGAs/s400/1569-4-secret-of-monkey-island-the.jpg" alt="Hovering with mouse over lens object offers action &quot;look at lens&quot;" title="Monkey Island GUI" /></a></p>
<p><em>Secret of Monkey Island ©1990 LucasArts. Image from old-games.com</em></p>
<p>A common way to operate on an object in traditional adventure games is to hover the mouse over it and then select the action you want to apply to it. In later (3D) games you might even zoom in of the object and rotate it around with your mouse to see if there are some clues to be had.</p>
<p>While Evennia and modern UI clients <em>may</em> allow you to use the mouse to select objects, I wanted this to work the traditional MUD-way, by inserting commands. So I decided that you as a player would be in one of two states:</p>
<ul>
<li>The &#x27;normal&#x27; state: When you use <strong>look</strong> you see the room description.</li>
<li>The &#x27;focused&#x27; state: You focus on a specific object with the <strong>examine <target></strong> command (aliases are <strong>ex</strong> or just <strong>e</strong>). Now object-specific actions become available to you. Use <strong>examine</strong> again to &quot;un-focus&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-E-J-PZZ2KbY/XOAWidK1Y_I/AAAAAAAAKek/mcWbgVNkvVkBBZEUpOuaaWyBVkNoE7K9gCEwYBhgL/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2019-05-17%2B11-41-50.png"><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-E-J-PZZ2KbY/XOAWidK1Y_I/AAAAAAAAKek/mcWbgVNkvVkBBZEUpOuaaWyBVkNoE7K9gCEwYBhgL/s400/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2019-05-17%2B11-41-50.png" alt="A small stone fireplace sits in the middle of the wall opposite the [door]. On the chimney hangs a small oil [painting] of a man. Hanging over the hearth is a black [cauldron]. The piles of [ashes] below are cold.  (It looks like fireplace may be suitable to [climb].)" title="Examining a fireplace" /></a></p>
<p>In the example above, the fireplace points out other objects you could also focus on, whereas the last parenthesis includes one or more &quot;actions&quot; that you can perform on the fireplace only when you have it focused.</p>
<p>This ends up pretty different from most traditional MUD-style inputs. When I first released this to the public, I found people logged off after their first examine. It turned out that they couldn&#x27;t figure out how to leave the focus mode. So they just assumed the thing was buggy and quit instead. Of course it&#x27;s mentioned if you care to write <strong>help</strong>, but this is clearly one step too many for such an important UI concept.</p>
<p>So I ended up adding the header above that always reminds you. And since then I&#x27;ve not seen any confusion over how the focus mode works.</p>
<p>For making it easy to focus on things, I also decided that each room would only ever have one object named a particular thing. So there is for example only one single object in the game named &quot;key&quot; that you can focus on.</p>
<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>I wanted players to co-exist in the same room so that they could collaborate on solving it. This meant communication must be possible. I pictured people would want to point things out and talk to each other.</p>
<p>In my first round of revisions I had a truckload of individual emotes; you could</p>
<p><strong>point at target</strong></p>
<p>for example. In the end I just limited it to</p>
<p><strong>say/shout/whisper <message></strong></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><strong>emote <whatever></strong></p>
<p>And seeing what people actually use, this is more than enough (<strong>say</strong> alone is probably 99% of what people need, really). I had a notion that the shout/whisper could be used in a puzzle later but in the end I decided that communication commands should be strictly between players and not have anything to do with the puzzles.</p>
<p>I removed all other interaction: There is no fighting and without an inventory or requirement to collaborate on puzzles, there is no need for other interactions than to communicate.</p>
<p>First version you didn&#x27;t even see what the others did, but eventually I added so that you at least saw what other players were focusing on at the moment (and of course if some major thing was solved/found).</p>
<p>In the end I don&#x27;t even list characters as objects in the room (you have to use the <strong>who</strong> command to see who&#x27;s in there with you).</p>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JVAZ65CrRZ0/XOAWibmcrhI/AAAAAAAAKeg/_YopP6nWqPUqK6B3JD_54RDqvE5a_fijQCEwYBhgL/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2019-05-17%2B11-38-49.png"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JVAZ65CrRZ0/XOAWibmcrhI/AAAAAAAAKeg/_YopP6nWqPUqK6B3JD_54RDqvE5a_fijQCEwYBhgL/s400/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2019-05-17%2B11-38-49.png" alt="Listing of commands available in the Evscaperoom (output of the help-command in game)" title="Help command output" /></a></p>
<p>The main <strong>help</strong> command output.</p>
<h2>Story</h2>
<p>It&#x27;s very common for this type of game to have a dangerous or scary theme. Things like &quot;get out before the bomb explodes&quot;, &quot;save the space ship before the engines overheat&quot;, &quot;flee the axe murderer before he comes back&quot; etc). I&#x27;m no stranger to dark themes, but for this I wanted something friendlier and brighter, maybe with a some dark undercurrents here and there.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/griatch-art/art/Say-hi-to-Mrs-Buttons-153984575">Jester character</a> is someone I&#x27;ve not only depicted in art, but she&#x27;s also an old RP character and literary protagonist of mine. Who else would find it funny to lock someone into a room only to provide crazy puzzles and hints for them to get out again? So my flimsy &#x27;premise&#x27; was this:</p>
<p><em>The village Jester wants to win the pie eating contest. You are one of her most dangerous opponents. She tricked you to her cabin and now you are locked in! If you don&#x27;t get out in time, she&#x27;ll get to eat all those pies on her own and surely win!</em></p>
<p>That&#x27;s it - this became the premise from which the entire game flowed. I quickly decided that it to be a very &quot;small-scale&quot; story: no life-or-death situation, no saving of the world. The drama takes place in a small village with an &quot;adversary&quot; that doesn&#x27;t really want to hurt you, but only to eat more pies than you.</p>
<p>From this, the way to offer hints came naturally - just eat a slice of &quot;hintberry pie&quot; the jester made (she even encourage you to eat it). It gives you a hint but is also very filling. So if you eat too much, how will you beat her in the contest later, even if you do get out?</p>
<p>To further the rustic and friendly tone I made sure the story took place on a warm summer day. Many descriptions describe sunshine, chirping birds and the smell of pie. I aimed at letting the text point out quirky and slightly comedic tone of the puzzles the Jester left behind. The player also sometimes gets teased by the game when doing things that does not make sense.</p>
<p>I won&#x27;t go into the story further here - it&#x27;s best if you experience it yourself. Let&#x27;s just say that the village has some old secrets. And and the Jester has her own ways of doing things and of telling a story. The game has multiple endings and so far people have drawn very different conclusions in the end.</p>
<h2>Scoring</h2>
<p>Most often in escape rooms, final score is determined by the time and the number of hints used. I do keep the latter - for every pie you eat, you get a penalty on your final score.</p>
<p>As for time - this background story <em>would</em> fit very well with a time limit (get out in X time, after which the pie-eating contest will start!). But from experience with other online text-based games I decided against this. Not only should a player be able to take a break, they may also want to wait for a friend to leave and come back etc.</p>
<p>But more importantly, I want players to explore and read all my carefully crafted descriptions! So I&#x27;d much rather prefer they take their time and reward them for being thorough.</p>
<p>So in the end I give specific scores for actions throughout the game instead. Most points are for doing things that drive the story forward, such as using something or solving a puzzle. But a significant portion of the score comes from turning every stone and trying everything out. The nice side-effect of this is that even if you know exactly how to solve everything and rush through the game you will still not end up with a perfect score.</p>
<p>The final score, adjusted by hints is then used to determine if you make it in time to the contest and how you fare. This means that if you explore carefully you have a &quot;buffer&quot; of points so eating a few pies may still land you a good result in the end.</p>

<h2>First sketch</h2>
<p>I really entered the game &#x27;building&#x27; aspect with no real notion of how the Jester&#x27;s cabin should look nor which puzzles should be in it. I tried to write things down beforehand but it didn&#x27;t really work for me.</p>
<p>So in the end I decided &quot;let&#x27;s just put a lot of interesting stuff in the room and then I&#x27;ll figure out how they interact with each other&quot;. I&#x27;m sure this is different from game-maker to game-maker. But for me, this process worked perfectly.</p>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3mV7GIsQbDo/XOBI3SX6bmI/AAAAAAAAKe8/DSYB7q6otCwLkKb1JNTco6kTJ1UEbVp1ACKgBGAs/s1600/20190515_230856.jpg"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3mV7GIsQbDo/XOBI3SX6bmI/AAAAAAAAKe8/DSYB7q6otCwLkKb1JNTco6kTJ1UEbVp1ACKgBGAs/s640/20190515_230856.jpg" alt="Scribbles on my notebook, sketching up the room&#x27;s main items" title="Scriblles on notebook" /></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My first, very rough, sketch of the Jester&#x27;s cabin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above, first sketch ended up being what I used, although many of the objects mentioned never ended up in the final game and some things switched places. I did some other sketches too, but they&#x27;d be spoilers so I won&#x27;t show them here ...</p>
<h2>The actual game logic</h2>
<p>The Evscaperoom principles outlined above deviate quite a bit from the traditional MU* style of game play.</p>
<p>While Evennia provides everything for database management, in-game objects, commands, networking and other resources, the specifics of your game is something you need to make yourself - and you have the full power of Python to do it!</p>
<p>So for the first three days of the jam I used Evennia to build the custom game logic needed to provide the evscaperoom style of game play. I also made the tools I needed to quickly create the game content (which then took me the rest of the jam to make).</p>
<p>In part 2 of this blog post I will cover the technical details of the Evscaperoom I built. I&#x27;ll also go through some issues I ran into and conclusions I drew. I&#x27;ll link to that from here when it&#x27;s available!</p>

<p>In the last few months, development of the upcoming <a href="http://www.evennia.com/">Evennia</a> 0.9 has been steaming on. Evennia is, as you may know, a Python library for creating text-based multiplayer games (MUDs, MUSH etc).<br />
But it&#x27;s not all backend work! There is also some sweet game-jamming going on, I get to that at the end.</p>
<h3>Evennia progress towards Python3</h3>
<p>The regular Evennia <em>develop</em> branch is now running completely in Python 3. Since we are using some new features of this Python release, we will be aiming for Python 3.7 as a minimum version once Evennia 0.9 goes stable. We will also use Django 2.1 and likely Twisted 19 - so we&#x27;ll be pretty much up-to-date on all our main dependencies.</p>
<p>Now, while the release of Evennia 0.9 is still some time away (there are a bunch of regular bug fixes and minor features that I want to get in there too (see the progress <a href="https://github.com/evennia/evennia/projects/8">here on the github 0.9 project page</a>), it&#x27;s worth to consider how much work it&#x27;ll be for you to migrate and if you should wait or jump in right now.</p>
<p>If you are new, I still recommend you use regular <em>master</em> branch Evennia (using Python 2.7). This is for which all wiki articles and documentation online is currently written after all. Once we move to python3, you&#x27;ll need to convert your code ... but syntactically the two are really not that different and conversion should not be much of an issue.</p>
<p>Not only are there automatic converters for most stuff, you should only need to do one pass to make sure things work and then you&#x27;ll be done. <a href="https://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_python_2_3_key_diff.html">This article</a> is pretty old but it serves well to identify the main differences. Later Py3 versions just adds new stuff which you would just not have had access to in Python2.7. Once 0.9 is released, we&#x27;ll also make guides for how you go about converting existing code (apart from the wealth of info on this topic online).</p>
<p>That said, if you are feeling more adventurous, or <em>really</em> want to use Python3 right away, many of the Evennia developer regulars have been running and testing <em>develop</em> branch for months now. It&#x27;s overall been a pretty painless transition - as said, py3 is not that different from py2.</p>
<p>However, <em>develop</em> branch has other features beyond the py3 jump. And those are not yet documented in the main docs. So you&#x27;ll have to contend with that (but asking in chat/forum works of course). However while it works fine for development already, as a matter of principle I <em>do not</em> recommend ever using Evennia&#x27;s <em>develop</em> branch for a production game - it can change quickly and may occationally be broken. You have been warned!</p>
<h3>Game Jam</h3>
<p>We are now a little more than a week into the <a href="https://mudcoders.com/">Mud Coders Guild</a>&#x27;s second yearly <a href="https://itch.io/jam/enterthemud2">Game Jam</a>. This year&#x27;s theme is &quot;One Room&quot;.</p>
<p>I really hope some more Evennia devs jump on this one because Evennia is perfect for this kind of experimental games. This is because Evennia is not imposing a game style on you - while there are default commands you are free to replace or customize the commands, objects and every aspect of your game to be as specific as you want to your game.</p>
<p>For example, I have a small Game Jam contribution in the works, where I very quickly reworked the default Evennia setup to pretty much make it into a different genre of game.</p>
<p>Usually the systems I make for Evennia are generic and intended for any game-type. By contrast, making somehing highly niched is super-fast to do: Building a whole new framework for game mechanisms along with build helpers for me to quickly make content took no more than three days.</p>
<p>There will no doubt be some iteration, but I hope to spend the rest of the jam time on content and gameplay. I have some RL things happening in the coming weeks (including work on Evennia proper) but if I can get the time to tie my jam entry together, I&#x27;ll likely make one or two blog posts about how it was developed and my reasons for making the choices i did. Most likely the code will appear as an Evennia contribution in case people want to do something similar for their own projects.</p>
<p>So, busy days.</p>

<p>A new year has come around and it&#x27;s time to both look back at the old and onward to the future of <a href="https://www.evennia.com/">Evennia</a>, the Python MUD creation system!</p>
<h4>Last year</h4>
<p><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BKHBV0L443U/W7EgLdZIQmI/AAAAAAAAJZs/CpmGtCk6U_QyoXGIEyQbIPBUmAbPbOgawCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2018-09-30%2B21-09-55.png"><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BKHBV0L443U/W7EgLdZIQmI/AAAAAAAAJZs/CpmGtCk6U_QyoXGIEyQbIPBUmAbPbOgawCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2018-09-30%2B21-09-55.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Last year saw the release of <a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=8338260444057832583#editor/target=post;postID=7101674864552615043;onPublishedMenu=allposts;onClosedMenu=allposts;postNum=2;src=postname">Evennia 0.8</a>. This version of Evennia changes some fundamental aspects of the server infrastructure so that the server can truly run in daemon mode as you would expect (no more running it in a GnuScreen session if you want to see logging to the terminal). It also adds the new Online Creation System, which lets builders create and define prototypes using a menu system as well as big improvements in the web client, such as multiple window-panes (allows the user to assign text to different windows to keep their client uncluttered) as well as plenty of fixes and features to help ease life for the Evennia developer. Thanks again to everyone who helped out and contributed to the release of Evennia 0.8!</p>
<p>On a personal note, I spoke about Evennia at PyCon Sweden this December, which was fun. I might put up my talk and make a more detailed blog post about that in the future, but my talk got a surprising amount of attention and positive feedback. Clearly many people have fond memories of MUDs and enjoy seeing they are not only still around but are possible to create in Python!</p>
<h4>This year</h4>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zNtXFGrN344/XC0MhJjWzcI/AAAAAAAAJ1M/UDd_QQRYuh8GNuXefblRIh6qfcDB9784QCLcBGAs/s1600/61SA0Wq1P1L.png"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zNtXFGrN344/XC0MhJjWzcI/AAAAAAAAJ1M/UDd_QQRYuh8GNuXefblRIh6qfcDB9784QCLcBGAs/s200/61SA0Wq1P1L.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Now we are steaming ahead towards Evennia 0.9! Already we have had a large number of contributions towards this release. A coming change is a much improved central way to make typeclass information available to a website as well as central ways to do various common operations like creating characters and linking them to Accounts. Much of this functionality is today hidden in the various default commands. In Evennia 0.9 they will be moved into more easily-findable locations as library functions everyone can just trigger without having to copy functionality.</p>
<p>The biggest change for Evennia 0.9 is however that we will now finally move Evennia over to <strong>Python 3</strong>. This is now possible as all our dependencies are now sufficiently ported. As discussed in the community for a long time, this will be a clean break - we will not offer any mid-way solution of Python2/3 but will drop Python2 support entirely. We will at the same time move to Django 2.+. In Django 0.9 we will however probably not use any special Python3 features yet. It should hopefully not be too difficult for our users to upgrade, but we&#x27;ll of course publish extensive instructions and help when that time comes.</p>
<p>We will likely support a minimum of Python 3.6 and maybe 3.7.  This work is currently happening in a separate branch <strong>develop-py3</strong> which will soonish merge into the current Python2.7-based <strong>develop</strong> branch and become Evennia 0.9 when it merges into <strong>master</strong> branch at an unknown time later this year.</p>
<p>There are a slew of other things planned for Evennia 0.9 and you can <a href="https://github.com/evennia/evennia/projects/8">follow the progress from our project page</a>. If you want to help out you are of course also very welcome. If you are new and are interested in getting your feet wet in helping out with Open-source development, we have <a href="https://github.com/evennia/evennia/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">a list of good first issues you could jump into</a>.</p>
<p>Onward into the new year!</p>
